## How to test the frontend on your local testnet

1. run ganache-cli with your metamask-addresses

> ganache-cli -m "your twelve seeed words "

2. deploy the contracts to your network

> truffle migrate --reset

3. run the frontend

> npm run dev

4. run the script to create local assessments!

> node create2concepts2assessments.js 

5. navigate to the assessment-view

copy the assessment address from the scripts output and add it to the url below.
Like this:

http://localhost:8080/#/assessment/<assessmentAddress>

## How to interact with deployed version of the fathom-network

To interact with the latest version of the fathom-network that has been deployed
to rinkeby, run

> ./scripts/loadDeployment.sh


Similarly, if you have deployed a new version of the network, use the saving script to save it to the deployments-folder:

> ./scripts/saveDeployment.sh

By default both of these scripts act on the deployment saved in
'deployments/rinkeby'. If you want to save or load to/from another directory,
pass the name as a parameter.

The script to save also has an optional description parameter that can be used
to generate a readme.txt in the respective folder

> ./scripts/saveDeployment.sh kovan "super cool latest feature and also some relevant tweaks"
