** deploy fathom to testnet
*** deploy via a script in geth console 
**** setup: 
***** (always add --rinkeby flag)
***** or --dev for testing on local chain
**** export private key account 2 from metamask
***** get account import path2key
***** pw: fathom1
**** compile bin and abi
     solc --combined-json abi,bin contracts/Assessment.sol -o ABIs/ --overwrite
**** put it in a script how to: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Managing-your-accounts
**** better: create web3deployscript by copying code from remix:
**** unlock account
     geth --unlock <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --password
     or later on:
     personal.unlockAccount(address, "password")
**** general Idea: run scriupt from whtin geth console:
     - >loadScript(path)
       -> copy the 2_deploy_contract as much as possible into that script
**** link contracts to deployed Math contract:
***** manually with solc:
      solc --optimize --bin ConceptRegistry.sol | solc --link --libraries "Math.sol:Math:0x28d5671f5da5a87e30275bd9b18b5b576278c865"
***** automatically with js:
      -check code in web3deploy.js
**** encountered trouble!!: 
***** loading the combinedjsons into geth-console is failing
      - geth --preload option fails, also I can not run a script in geth-console that requires other packages
      - workaround: put monsterjson with all abi's and bin's at the beginning
***** deploying the pure bytecode from geth-console fails
      - just says 'fails'
**** 2 try next:
*** deployed contracs:
**** math:
     0x28d5671f5da5a87e30275bd9b18b5b576278c865
