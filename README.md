About
========

An Ethereum based solution for peer assessment based on a participatory token economy. You get tokens through assessment, you pay them to get assessed. This system is an abstracted assessment framework capable of assessing anything that can be defined through a hierarchical ontology.
For more documentation see our [whitepaper](http://fathom.network/whitepaper/).

Concept Structure
============

To define an assessment we use a hierarchical structure from most general to most specific. For example, if you wanted to be assessed in creating a Hello World program in Python you would create that assessment on the Hello World concept, which would be a child of the Python concept, which would be a child of the Programming concept, et cetera. This allows us to pull assessors accurately, and group similar tasks together. 

Contract Structure
==============

The system is based upon a data store and management contract:
`conceptRegistry`, which can be used to create new Concepts. Concepts manage the
creation and storage of `assessments`. Assessments are paid for in the native
token of the network, defined in `FathomToken`.


Dependencies
========

Install all dependencies by running 

> npm i

This will install 
- [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) (formerly named testrpc), to run your private testnet,
- [truffle-hd-walletprovider](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-hdwallet-provider) to manage keys when deploying to rinkeby and
- [ethjs-abi](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs-abi) and [ethereumjs-abi](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-abi), to be able to run all our tests.

Deployment
========

Deploying a fathom-network-instance will lead the following contracts being on-chain:

- ConceptRegistry.sol, to manage creation of new concepts
- FathomToken.sol, to manage payments
- One instance of Concept.sol, being the root of the concept-tree (the _MEW-concept_)
- Math.sol, a library to do scoring and clustering

### ...to a private testnet

Open a console and run your private testnet:
> ganache-cli

In another console, run the migration: 
>'truffle migrate'


### ...to the rinkeby-testnet

As you want to deploy to a real testnet, you need to have
[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed and some rinkeby-ether on its first
account. To generate your keys, create a file `secrets.json` in the uppermost
project folder ('./'), where you save the seed-phrase that underlies the account
that pays for the deployment. (Metamask -> Settings -> Reveal Seed Words) 

Your secrets.json-file should look like this: 
>'{"seed": "baseball poet vague session shrimp humus embrace glare monkey donkey balony bread"}'

#### 1) Specify the initial AHA-Owner

You need to provide at least one address to which all the initial tokens will be
distributed. 
To do so, create a file `./intitialMembers.json` in the root-folder of the
project.

**NB : the teamTestAddresses.json file contains the core team's addresses and can be renamed to intitialMembers.json for testing purposes. (Don't forget to put the address controlled by the seeds in the first position though)

Its content should look like this:
>'{"accounts": ["0xaccount1...", "0xaccount2...", ... ]}'

It must hold at least one account, which will the one that will receive all the
AHA-tokens. To modify the amount, open `/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` and
set the variable `initialAmount` to the desired value.

#### 2) Specify an initial set of users and distribute tokens to them

_*NOTE*: If you *DON'T* want to the MEW-concept to have any initial members nor
distribute tokens to them, remove the third and fourth migration-file and
continue at step 3). (Be aware that this you'll have to manually call the
distributor and add the first member to the MEW-concept before any assessment
can be run in your system.)_

If you *DO* want to seed the network with some initial users in the mew-concept
add them to the list of initial accounts.

_OPTIONAL_: If you want to be able to add more members than specified in the
list, adjust the `nInitialMewMembers`-variable in `/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`
to that end.

#### 3) Configure token & member distribution

By default, all tokens will be distributed amongst all addresses in the
initial-member list and all addresses will be added to MEW. If you want to
change that play around with the parameters in `/migrations/3_fund_users.js` and
`/migrations/4_add_members_to_mew.js` respectively.

#### 4) Deploy

Lastly, run 
>'truffle migrate --network rinkeby'


#### 5) Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error-message saying 'Unknown number of arguments to
  solidity-function' it sometimes helps to recompile everything: 
  > rm -rf ./build

- If you get any other issues feel free to open an issue or add to an existing
one.

Styleguide
==========

#### Solidity

We follow the [solidity-style
guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html) and have
recently committed to using the
[solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/rules.html)-linter to enforce it.

After installing it, simply run 
> solhint ./contracts/xxx.sol

until _your_ code does not generate any errors or warnings.

_NOTE:_ Due to our recent adoption of the linter, our codebase is not 100%
compliant with it yet. If you lint your merge-request, make sure to only heed
warnings and errors that are relevant to your new code. If you want to fix other
code too, please do so in the context of a separate issue.

#### Javascript

We follow Standard JS style guide.

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

To use its linter, run the following command:
```
npm run lint
```
This will check all JavaScript files in the current working directory and call attention to any code that needs fixing.
