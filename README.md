About
========

This is a frontend to run assesments for the
[fathom-network](https://fathom.network/).


Build
========

Install all dependencies:

> npm i

Make sure your Metamask is set to the kovan or rinkeby testnet, then serve the
frontend by running

> npm run dev

Developing
========

### Deploy the contracts to your local development testnet

1) Make sure you have ganache-cli installed

> npm i -g ganache-cli

2) Fire up ganache with the seedwords of your Metamask instance

> ganache-cli -m 'your twelve seed words should be here in bla bla blub'

3) Change into the fathom-contracts module folder

> cd ./node_modules/fathom-contracts

4) From there, deploy the contracts 

> truffle migrate --reset

### Create new concepts and assessments

Use the script to create assessments in new concepts

> node scripts/create2concepts2assessments.js

You can also pass 'kovan' or 'rinkeby' as an argument to create the concepts and
assessments on the respective testnet.


### Run assessments until a certain stage

On you local testnet (only!), you can also run assessments (new ones or existing
ones) until a given stage, e.g. to have 5 assessors commit the scores four 90's
and a 70:

> node scripts/completeAssessment -s commit 90,90,90,90,70

See the comments in the first lines of completeAssessment.js for more options.
