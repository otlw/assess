About
========

This is a frontend to run assesments for the
[fathom-network](https://fathom.network/).


Build
========

Install all dependencies:

` npm i`

Make sure your Metamask is set to the kovan or rinkeby testnet, then serve the
frontend by running

` npm run dev`

Developing
========

### Deploy the contracts to your local development testnet

1. If you don't have ganache install it with: `npm i -g ganache-cli`

2. Fire up ganache with the seedwords of your Metamask instance
```
ganache-cli -m 'your twelve seed words should be here in bla bla blub'
```

3. Deploy the contracts by running `npm run deploy-testnet`

### Create new concepts and assessments

Use the script to create assessments in new concepts

`node scripts/create2concepts2assessments.js`

You can also pass 'kovan' or 'rinkeby' as an argument to create the concepts and
assessments on the respective testnet.


### Run assessments until a certain stage

On you local testnet (only!), you can also run assessments (new ones or existing
ones) until a given stage, e.g. to have 5 assessors commit the scores four 90's
and a 70:

` node scripts/completeAssessment -s commit 90,90,90,90,70`

See the comments in the first lines of completeAssessment.js for more options.

### NB: On a testnet, you can deploy contracts and create example concepts and assessments with a one line script:

` npm run full-deploy-testnet`

- deploys contracts
- creates 2 concepts and 2 assessments
- creates assessments ran until each possible step, for testing purposes
